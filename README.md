# Objective:
Create a list of Crypto coins and populate the list by showing Name, Symbol, type. Create an UI for showing the list of crypto coins with filter & search options.

# UI Description:
1. Create a UI to show the list of all the crypto coins.
2. Each coin view should show the Coin Name, Symbol, type.
3. Each coin view should show disabled if the coin is not active.
4. UI should have a Filter option with following filter options. And users can apply multiple filters at the same time.
    a. Filter by active(is_active)
    b. Filter by coin type(type)
    c. Filter by new crypto(is_new)

# Points to be considered for evaluation:
1. Architecture (preferably Clean or MVVM) that can be scaled and used as a production codebase.
2. Responsibility segregation in modules
3. Specific to iOS: Clean UI (with no constraint warnings, preferably develop UI through code)

# Guidelines for iOS

Acceptance Criteria
Your selection chances are higher if
1. You use the latest version of Swift.
2. You create UI Programmatically using UIKit Framework
3. You adhere to Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines and coding conventions.
4. Your app performs well in terms of CPU, memory and energy usage.
5. Your code is loosely coupled, testable and uses an architecture similar to VIPER, MVVM, MVP, etc.
6. You tastefully customise the UI and add animations etc.
7. Your app does not have too many dependencies on third party frameworks.
8. Your app runs smoothly offline.

Note: We may reject your application if
1. Your project fails to compile or compiled with warnings with the latest version of Xcode.
2. If you use Swift UI
3. Your app does not layout correctly for all iOS devices that can run the current release of iOS.
4. Your app has UI/logical flaws that make it difficult to use.
5. You do not have unit tests in your application with decent code coverage.
6. Your unit tests fail.
7. If auto layout engine throws constraints error during runtime.
